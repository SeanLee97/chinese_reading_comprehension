Implementation of [Attention-over-Attention Neural Networks for Reading Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04423) for Chinese Reading Comprehension in pytorch

### environment
* linux
* python3.6
* pytorch

### dataset

you`d better use the [People Daily & Children's Fairy Tale (CFT) ](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-RC-Dataset) to train the model, and you have to rewrite the preprocess.py to suit the project
